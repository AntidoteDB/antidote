  %% Options for environmental variables
  %% txn_cert:
  %%        true -> write operations are certified during commit, aborting the transaction if a write conflict is detected (i.e. snapshot isolation
  %%                is ensured for the updates within a single DC, updates across DCs are not checked)
  %%        false -> transactions perform no certification and always commit (outside of crashes/errors)
  %% txn_prot:
  %%        clocksi -> uses "Cure" protocol to define snapshots and causal dependencies (https://pages.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/Cure-final-ICDCS16.pdf)
  %%        gr -> uses "Gentle-rain like" protocol to define snapshots and causal dependencies (https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/202079)
  %% recover_from_log:
  %%        true -> on node start will load any operations stored on the disk log to the in memory cache of the key-value store
  %%        false -> on node start the state of the key-value store will be empty
  %% recover_meta_data_on_start:
  %%        true -> meta-data state will be loaded from disk on restart including connection state between other DCs and node names and configurations,
  %%                nodes will automatically reconnect to other dcs on restart
  %%        false -> meta-data concerning node names and connections to other dcs will not be loaded on restart
  %% sync_log:
  %%        true -> local transactions will be stored on log synchronously, i.e. when the reply is sent the updates are guaranteed to be
  %%                stored to disk (this is very slow in the current logging setup)
  %%        false -> all updates are sent to the operating system to be stored to disk (eventually), but are not guaranteed to be stored durably on disk
  %%                 when the reply is sent
  %% %% auto_start_read_servers:
  %%        true -> read servers will start automatically. It should be set to true when Antidote will be run in a single node/machine.
  %%        false -> read servers will not start automatically. It should be set to false when many Antidote instances will be run in a cluster.
  %%                 In this case, a inter_dc_manager:start_bg_processes(stable) needs to be issued per antidote instance after joining the cluster.
  %% %% enable_logging:
  %%        true -> writes to disk done by the logging_vnode are enabled
  %%        false -> writes to disk are disabled, this improves performance when benchmarking.
  %%        WARNING: disabling logging makes updates non-recoverable after shutting down antidote or under failures.
  %% %% collect_metrics_staleness
  %%        true -> periodically calculates staleness and record it in exometer which can be read by monitoring
  %%        tools. It is false by default. Changing this parameter during run time
  %%        has no effect.
