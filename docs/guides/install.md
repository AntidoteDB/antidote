# Quickstart

We're still too early for a proper user guide. However, if you're brave, you can try the following steps.

## Fire up Antidote

See [the Antidote docs on running in Docker](https://antidotedb.gitbook.io/documentation/deployment/docker).

## Add Vax dependency

Include [Vax](https://github.com/vaxine-io/vax) as a dependency in your Elixir app.

## Follow the examples

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/vaxine-io/examples).

Good luck!
