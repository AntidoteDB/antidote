# Contributing to Vaxine

Welcome to the Vaxine developer community. Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This guide covers two main topics:

1. the [legal terms](#legal-terms) under which you contribute to the project
2. the [guidelines](#contributor-guidelines) for how to contribute to the project

## Legal terms

Vaxine operates under the
[default GitHub terms](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license),
where your contributions are licensed under the terms of our
contributor license agreement. The
[Vaxine Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/vaxine-io/meta/blob/master/CLA.md) ("CLA") is a legal agreement that essentially assigns the IP in your contributions to the Vaxine project.

### How do I accept the CLA?

The **Vaxine repositories** are defined as any repository hosted on the GitHub platform within the [vaxine-io](https://github.com/vaxine-io) organisation. For example, this includes but is not limited to [vaxine-io/vax](https://github.com/vaxine-io/vax), [vaxine-io/mesh](https://github.com/vaxine-io/mesh), etc.

By contributing code to any of the Vaxine repositories, for example by pushing commits to GitHub and / or by raising a Pull Request, you indicate your acceptance of the CLA.

<blockquote>
  :warning: Do not contributing code to any of the Vaxine repositories unless you accept the Vaxine Contributor License Agreement. Contributing code to the Vaxine repositories indicates your acceptance of the terms.
</blockquote>

## Contributor Guidelines

Please read the guideance below about what to do if you:

- [found a bug](#did-you-find-a-bug)
- [fixed a bug](#did-you-write-a-patch-that-fixes-a-bug)
- [want to add a new feature or change an existing one](#do-you-intend-to-add-a-new-feature-or-change-an-existing-one)

### Did you find a bug?

* ensure that the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under the relevant issue tracker
* if you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one

Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* open a new GitHub pull request with the patch
* ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* say hello and suggest your change on the discussion channels for the [Vaxine community](https://vaxine.io/project/community)
* assuming you get positive feedback, raise a Pull Request against your fork/branch to track the development of the feature and discuss the implementation

Then write some code ;) We welcome contributions and encourage you to pitch in :)
